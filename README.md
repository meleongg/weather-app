# weather-app

## Purpose
This is a weather application that displays weather data based on a city that the user provides. The user can also convert the temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit. 
## What I learned 
- asynchronous JS syntax with async & await
- JS Promises with .then(), .catch(), & try catch blocks
- using the Fetch API & OpenWeatherMap API to fetch & display data
